# MaddenToCSV
Powershell script which allows the Madden Companion Application to export directly to CSV files on your local computer.

# Usage Notes
- If your system has disabled running local powershell scripts, you can enable using command "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser remotesigned"
- Team names are not included in the rosters.csv file.  They must be mapped from the table in leagueInfo.csv using the TeamID column
